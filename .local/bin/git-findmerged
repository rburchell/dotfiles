# find all local branches which are fully incorporated in `origin/master`
#
# this is similar to `git branch --merged origin/master`, except that it is not limited to fully
# merged branches (where the commit exists in the upstream branch). `git cherry` will find branches
# where all commits match an upstream commit, i.e. that would apply the same diff.
#
# Effectively, this finds branches where all commits have been added to `origin/master` using
# `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick`.
#
# It shouldn't be losing useful information, but ymmv.
