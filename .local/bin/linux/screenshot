# this is a replacement for gnome-screenshot --area --clipboard
# it's needed because gnome-screenshot fails to set the clipboard pretty much all the time:
# https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-screenshot/-/issues/159
# my guess is that this is probably down to a missing call to gtk_clipboard_set_can_store,
# since it exits so quickly, it subsequently gets lost.. but rather than dig into
# something that is essentially deprecated, i'm just going to replace it here.

# request an area to screenshot, via gnome-shell.
# gnome-screenshot has fallback code to handle this interface being missing, but I don't think I care.

#   int32 $x
#   int32 $y
#   int32 $width
#   int32 $height
